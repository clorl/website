In the beginning there was nothing. Well not entirely. I was lucky to be born after everyone else, after all those people who started coding in C or assembly, back when gaming wasn't the huge industry it's today, back when SDKs were mostly non-existant and visual editors had to be built in-house. Here is the story about why I became a game designer, and how it all started.

I started experimenting in making games with Game Maker and RPG Maker, the basics when you're a 13-year-old that has access to Google and can type "how to make game" in a reasonable amount of time. I always had this urge to be more than a consumer, and I have no idea why. When I saw a movie or played a game that truly moved me, the hyperactive nature inside me just wanted to do the same. Do something that great, write a story that cool, a game that clean. I have a rigorous mind by nature but, I get bored very easily, and so my experimentations on those very simple game engines didn't go very far.

# The SCP Foundation

Back in 2014, creepypastas were hype for any kid. That's when I discovered the french SCP Foundation, that weird website about that worldwide organization who kept paranormal creatures in boxes to study them. After a while of reading those and enjoying the chills, I discovered that it was basically open to contribution and decided to join. I think back then the age limit was minimum 16 y.o. for obvious reason, so I did what any reasonable would do : I lied about my age.

I discovered a very welcoming community of weird people, that liked weird stuff like horror stories, science fiction, programming, tabletop roleplaying. It was a big part in how I constructed my culture, and most notably why H.P. Lovecraft stays one of my favorite authors today. 

This community was harsh, they had a high standard for the website and how people should be : you had to write well, even in casual messages, you had to read the guides and only ask questions if you can't find the info by yourself. I think this experience educated me and played a big part in who I am today. I wrote a few SCPs, and then went onto writing [short fictions](http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/dilemme) [which you can still](http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/reminiscence) [read today](http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/dossier-personnel-du-dr-topy).

This is when I decided I could make a big project with a potential audience. So I went to create a game with RPG maker featuring the characters from the french universe. I spent a lot of time, with someone else from the branch, making pixel art characters, and I started scripting the game events and outlining the game's story. However, it was kind of uninspired, and the actual gameplay and difficulty was basically non-existence. During this project I discovered that I loved **using** a game engine, mapping, and letting people test my work. It was hard, and I got bored and blocked at some point, because of the lack of actual gameplay. I did spend a lot of time on details, custom interactions that would reward the player for exploring the world.

Anyways, the project stopped.

## The Aleph-team

After that, I worked on an original audio fiction based on the french SCP lore with a few friends from the community. We had lots of fun making it, and people seemed to like it. That's when we started wondering if we could make a smaller RPG game with a more limited scope. One of the members started experimenting with cartoon 3D models for characters, and we loved it. That's when we, as a team, started to call ourselves the "Aleph-team". The goal was simple : make cross-media projects for the SCP foundation. This is the first time I had to "lead" a team, I organized everything on discord, created task lists and design documents, what a cool experience.

So the 3D RPG thing changed to become a mobile endless-runner on mobile. I programmed the whole thing alone in blueprint, this was my first contact with UE4. And we went quite far honestly. We also had assets integrated later, but I couldn't find videos of that.

# Conclusion

So this is it, my very first video game project, how it all started. Game design came quite naturally to me, and I started documenting on the topic back then. I was immature, full of dreams, and I still get a bit nostalgic thinking about that time.
