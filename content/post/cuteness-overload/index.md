An old-school doom-like where your weapon is your pet, and the damage is love. Choose between two weapons : a cute doggy-dog, or a so-cute quack quack ducky. (Cat isn't an option, don't ask)

I gathered a team of close friends and we made a game in two days! The twist was that those friends never made games and I had to tutor them. They were very good, listening and willing to learn, and considering I was the only one who had a clue on how to make a game, I think we did pretty well.
